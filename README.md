# Flow Log Processing Project

## Overview

This project is designed to generate, process, and analyze synthetic network flow logs using Java. The project consists of three main components:

- **Flow Log Generator**: Generates synthetic flow log data that simulates various network traffic patterns.
- **Tag Rule Generator**: Creates tag rules that can be used to categorize flow logs.
- **Flow Log Processor**: Processes the generated flow logs and tag rules to produce meaningful insights, such as counting unique port-protocol combinations and tag occurrences.

## Project Structure

The workspace is organized into the following folders:

- **`src`**: Contains all the Java source files for the project.
- **`lib`**: Contains any external libraries or dependencies required by the project.
- **`bin`**: The default output directory where the compiled class files are stored.
